FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 67,133 nodes and height 19, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 355,035 events initially, for 200,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 381,061 events, handled 7,968 and discarded 363,092; 10,001 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 207,973 out of cell events (6,576 handled, 196,324 discarded)
FINE    |  → 173,088 merge events (1,392 handled, 166,768 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
