FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 35,545 nodes and height 18, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 177,043 events initially, for 100,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 193,000 events, handled 4,618 and discarded 113,253; 75,129 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 104,623 out of cell events (3,696 handled, 60,235 discarded)
FINE    |  → 88,377 merge events (922 handled, 53,018 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
