FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using ROBUST + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 45,681 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 100,101 events, handled 1,474 and discarded 44,768; 53,859 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 41,811 out of cell events (705 handled, 12,194 discarded)
FINE    |  → 58,290 merge events (769 handled, 32,574 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
