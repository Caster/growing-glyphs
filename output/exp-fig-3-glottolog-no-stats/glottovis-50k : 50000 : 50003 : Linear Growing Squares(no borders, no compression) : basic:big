FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 19,265 nodes and height 16, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 88,143 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 99,037 events, handled 2,810 and discarded 93,740; 2,487 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 52,809 out of cell events (2,179 handled, 49,522 discarded)
FINE    |  → 46,228 merge events (631 handled, 44,218 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
