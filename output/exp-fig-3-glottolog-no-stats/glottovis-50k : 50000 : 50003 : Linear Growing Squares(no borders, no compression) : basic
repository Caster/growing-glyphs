FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 19,265 nodes and height 16, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 88,148 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 106,129 events, handled 5,208 and discarded 66,943; 33,978 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 55,598 out of cell events (3,465 handled, 33,992 discarded)
FINE    |  → 50,531 merge events (1,743 handled, 32,951 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
