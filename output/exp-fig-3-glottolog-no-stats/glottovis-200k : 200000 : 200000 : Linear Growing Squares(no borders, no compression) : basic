FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 67,133 nodes and height 19, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 355,044 events initially, for 200,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 380,589 events, handled 9,564 and discarded 289,949; 81,076 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 209,833 out of cell events (7,719 handled, 156,336 discarded)
FINE    |  → 170,756 merge events (1,845 handled, 133,613 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
