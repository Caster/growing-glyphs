FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 35,545 nodes and height 18, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 177,048 events initially, for 100,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 199,287 events, handled 6,991 and discarded 191,365; 931 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 107,302 out of cell events (5,042 handled, 101,842 discarded)
FINE    |  → 91,985 merge events (1,949 handled, 89,523 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
