FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 24,909 nodes and height 25, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 87,481 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 127,525 events, handled 10,814 and discarded 54,962; 61,749 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 61,876 out of cell events (7,481 handled, 22,206 discarded)
FINE    |  → 65,649 merge events (3,333 handled, 32,756 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
