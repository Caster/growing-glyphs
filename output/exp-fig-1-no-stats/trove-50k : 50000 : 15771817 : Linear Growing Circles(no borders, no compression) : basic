FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 24,909 nodes and height 25, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 87,684 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 134,218 events, handled 11,431 and discarded 59,701; 63,086 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 65,290 out of cell events (8,114 handled, 25,050 discarded)
FINE    |  → 68,928 merge events (3,317 handled, 34,651 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
