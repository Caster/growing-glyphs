FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 24,909 nodes and height 25, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 87,628 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 746,336 events, handled 215,354 and discarded 523,447; 7,535 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 269,723 out of cell events (165,876 handled, 100,969 discarded)
FINE    |  → 476,613 merge events (49,478 handled, 422,478 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
