FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 16,601 nodes and height 8, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 87,787 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 337,880 events, handled 74,252 and discarded 263,608; 20 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 124,522 out of cell events (37,982 handled, 86,530 discarded)
FINE    |  → 213,358 merge events (36,270 handled, 177,078 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
