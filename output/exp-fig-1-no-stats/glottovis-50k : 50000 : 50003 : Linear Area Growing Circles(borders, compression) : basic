FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 19,265 nodes and height 16, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 88,126 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 555,591 events, handled 139,150 and discarded 414,200; 2,241 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 192,707 out of cell events (89,442 handled, 102,443 discarded)
FINE    |  → 362,884 merge events (49,708 handled, 311,757 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
