FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 16,601 nodes and height 8, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 87,788 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 115,118 events, handled 10,759 and discarded 748; 103,611 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 60,767 out of cell events (8,131 handled, 442 discarded)
FINE    |  → 54,351 merge events (2,628 handled, 306 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
