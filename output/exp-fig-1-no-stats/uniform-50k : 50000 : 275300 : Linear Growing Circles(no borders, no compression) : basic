FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 16,601 nodes and height 8, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 87,793 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 118,169 events, handled 12,096 and discarded 1,002; 105,071 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 62,097 out of cell events (9,297 handled, 590 discarded)
FINE    |  → 56,072 merge events (2,799 handled, 412 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
