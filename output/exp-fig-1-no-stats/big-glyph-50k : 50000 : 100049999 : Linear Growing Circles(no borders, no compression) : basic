FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 13,045 nodes and height 8, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 90,547 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 185,558 events, handled 15,838 and discarded 67,248; 102,472 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 65,914 out of cell events (171 handled, 19,790 discarded)
FINE    |  → 119,644 merge events (15,667 handled, 47,458 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
