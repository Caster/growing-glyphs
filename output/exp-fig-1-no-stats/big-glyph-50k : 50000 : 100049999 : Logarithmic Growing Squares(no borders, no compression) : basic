FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 13,045 nodes and height 8, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 90,547 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 275,605 events, handled 55,690 and discarded 219,865; 50 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 105,879 out of cell events (27,072 handled, 78,781 discarded)
FINE    |  → 169,726 merge events (28,618 handled, 141,084 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
