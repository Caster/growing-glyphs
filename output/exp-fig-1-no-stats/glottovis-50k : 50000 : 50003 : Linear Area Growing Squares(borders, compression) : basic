FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 19,265 nodes and height 16, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 88,142 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 537,067 events, handled 130,463 and discarded 404,525; 2,079 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 183,557 out of cell events (80,770 handled, 101,949 discarded)
FINE    |  → 353,510 merge events (49,693 handled, 302,576 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
