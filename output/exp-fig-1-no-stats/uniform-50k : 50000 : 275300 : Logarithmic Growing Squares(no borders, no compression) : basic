FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 16,601 nodes and height 8, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 87,793 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 315,534 events, handled 65,913 and discarded 249,604; 17 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 116,113 out of cell events (32,763 handled, 83,340 discarded)
FINE    |  → 199,421 merge events (33,150 handled, 166,264 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
