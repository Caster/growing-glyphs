FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 19,265 nodes and height 16, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 88,147 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 199,956 events, handled 30,664 and discarded 169,278; 14 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 81,189 out of cell events (14,831 handled, 66,344 discarded)
FINE    |  → 118,767 merge events (15,833 handled, 102,934 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
