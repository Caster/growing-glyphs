FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 13,045 nodes and height 8, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 90,538 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 452,553 events, handled 115,339 and discarded 294,174; 43,040 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 165,983 out of cell events (68,670 handled, 79,892 discarded)
FINE    |  → 286,570 merge events (46,669 handled, 214,282 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
