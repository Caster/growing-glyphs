FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 13,045 nodes and height 8, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 89,980 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 211,796 events, handled 15,745 and discarded 195,507; 544 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 65,729 out of cell events (247 handled, 65,381 discarded)
FINE    |  → 146,067 merge events (15,498 handled, 130,126 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
