FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 13,045 nodes and height 8, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 90,248 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 295,174 events, handled 62,807 and discarded 232,338; 29 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 113,006 out of cell events (31,327 handled, 81,659 discarded)
FINE    |  → 182,168 merge events (31,480 handled, 150,679 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
