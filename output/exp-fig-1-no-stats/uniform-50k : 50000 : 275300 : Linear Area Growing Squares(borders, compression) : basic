FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 16,601 nodes and height 8, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 87,793 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 457,817 events, handled 115,713 and discarded 323,024; 19,080 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 166,036 out of cell events (68,036 handled, 84,071 discarded)
FINE    |  → 291,781 merge events (47,677 handled, 238,953 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
