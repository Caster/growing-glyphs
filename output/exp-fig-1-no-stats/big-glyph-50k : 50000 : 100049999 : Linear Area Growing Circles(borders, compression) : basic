FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 13,045 nodes and height 8, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 90,524 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 464,885 events, handled 121,857 and discarded 294,901; 48,127 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 172,849 out of cell events (75,130 handled, 80,602 discarded)
FINE    |  → 292,036 merge events (46,727 handled, 214,299 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
