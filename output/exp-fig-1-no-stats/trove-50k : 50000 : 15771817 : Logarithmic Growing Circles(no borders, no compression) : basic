FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 24,909 nodes and height 25, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 87,642 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 260,321 events, handled 42,619 and discarded 217,690; 12 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 94,824 out of cell events (16,511 handled, 78,307 discarded)
FINE    |  → 165,497 merge events (26,108 handled, 139,383 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
