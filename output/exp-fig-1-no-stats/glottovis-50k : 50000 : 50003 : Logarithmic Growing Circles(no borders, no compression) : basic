FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 19,265 nodes and height 16, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 88,076 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 209,277 events, handled 33,518 and discarded 175,757; 2 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 84,231 out of cell events (16,745 handled, 67,486 discarded)
FINE    |  → 125,046 merge events (16,773 handled, 108,271 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
