FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 19,265 nodes and height 16, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 88,148 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 102,286 events, handled 4,541 and discarded 5,734; 92,011 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 54,996 out of cell events (3,672 handled, 2,929 discarded)
FINE    |  → 47,290 merge events (869 handled, 2,805 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
