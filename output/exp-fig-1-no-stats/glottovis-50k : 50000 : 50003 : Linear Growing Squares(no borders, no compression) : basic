FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 19,265 nodes and height 16, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 88,046 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 101,045 events, handled 4,450 and discarded 63,458; 33,137 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 54,830 out of cell events (3,616 handled, 33,133 discarded)
FINE    |  → 46,215 merge events (834 handled, 30,325 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
