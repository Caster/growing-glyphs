FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 16,601 nodes and height 8, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 87,793 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 473,821 events, handled 122,802 and discarded 338,458; 12,561 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 173,194 out of cell events (74,074 handled, 90,764 discarded)
FINE    |  → 300,627 merge events (48,728 handled, 247,694 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
