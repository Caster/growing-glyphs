FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 24,909 nodes and height 25, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 87,661 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 725,367 events, handled 206,079 and discarded 512,497; 6,791 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 260,356 out of cell events (156,560 handled, 100,955 discarded)
FINE    |  → 465,011 merge events (49,519 handled, 411,542 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
