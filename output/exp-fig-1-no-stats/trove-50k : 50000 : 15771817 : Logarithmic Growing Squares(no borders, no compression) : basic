FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 24,909 nodes and height 25, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 87,683 events initially, for 50,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 249,223 events, handled 40,298 and discarded 208,893; 32 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 91,632 out of cell events (15,071 handled, 76,541 discarded)
FINE    |  → 157,591 merge events (25,227 handled, 132,352 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
