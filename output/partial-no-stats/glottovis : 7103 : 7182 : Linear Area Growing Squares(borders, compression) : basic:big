FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 12,571 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 68,132 events, handled 16,418 and discarded 51,432; 282 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 23,691 out of cell events (9,518 handled, 14,076 discarded)
FINE    |  → 44,441 merge events (6,900 handled, 37,356 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
