FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using ROBUST + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 49,830 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 287,670 events, handled 9,369 and discarded 278,112; 189 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 91,514 out of cell events (2,817 handled, 88,593 discarded)
FINE    |  → 196,156 merge events (6,552 handled, 189,519 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
