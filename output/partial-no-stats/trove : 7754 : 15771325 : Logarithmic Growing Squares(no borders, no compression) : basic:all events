FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using ROBUST + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 49,830 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 279,832 events, handled 8,829 and discarded 270,774; 229 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 88,413 out of cell events (2,425 handled, 85,845 discarded)
FINE    |  → 191,419 merge events (6,404 handled, 184,929 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
