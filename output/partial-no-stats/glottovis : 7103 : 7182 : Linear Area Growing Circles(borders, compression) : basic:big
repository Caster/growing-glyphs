FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 12,571 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 70,557 events, handled 17,513 and discarded 52,922; 122 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 24,780 out of cell events (10,607 handled, 14,130 discarded)
FINE    |  → 45,777 merge events (6,906 handled, 38,792 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
