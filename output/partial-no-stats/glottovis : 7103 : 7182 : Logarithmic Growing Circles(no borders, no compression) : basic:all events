FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using ROBUST + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 45,681 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 157,607 events, handled 7,203 and discarded 150,213; 191 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 61,745 out of cell events (3,487 handled, 58,134 discarded)
FINE    |  → 95,862 merge events (3,716 handled, 92,079 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
