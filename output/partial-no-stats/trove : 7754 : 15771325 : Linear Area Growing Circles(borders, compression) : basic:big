FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 13,680 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 98,256 events, handled 26,236 and discarded 68,899; 3,121 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 36,374 out of cell events (18,798 handled, 16,268 discarded)
FINE    |  → 61,882 merge events (7,438 handled, 52,631 discarded)
