FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using ROBUST + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 49,830 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 273,948 events, handled 26,308 and discarded 217,528; 30,112 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 103,801 out of cell events (18,755 handled, 66,834 discarded)
FINE    |  → 170,147 merge events (7,553 handled, 150,694 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
