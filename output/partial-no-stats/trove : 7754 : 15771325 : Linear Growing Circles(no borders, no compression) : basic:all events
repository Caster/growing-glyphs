FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using ROBUST + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 49,830 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 457,831 events, handled 5,383 and discarded 377,418; 75,030 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 123,913 out of cell events (496 handled, 91,773 discarded)
FINE    |  → 333,918 merge events (4,887 handled, 285,645 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
