FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 13,680 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 98,672 events, handled 26,392 and discarded 69,143; 3,137 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 36,537 out of cell events (18,854 handled, 16,367 discarded)
FINE    |  → 62,135 merge events (7,538 handled, 52,776 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
