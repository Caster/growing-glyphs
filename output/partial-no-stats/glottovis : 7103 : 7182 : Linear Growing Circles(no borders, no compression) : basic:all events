FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using ROBUST + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 45,681 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 96,259 events, handled 1,426 and discarded 41,669; 53,164 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 41,399 out of cell events (698 handled, 11,729 discarded)
FINE    |  → 54,860 merge events (728 handled, 29,940 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
