FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 13,679 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 51,939 events, handled 9,456 and discarded 42,463; 20 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 17,359 out of cell events (2,889 handled, 14,458 discarded)
FINE    |  → 34,580 merge events (6,567 handled, 28,005 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
