FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 13,678 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 23,890 events, handled 1,217 and discarded 22,446; 227 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 8,976 out of cell events (231 handled, 8,559 discarded)
FINE    |  → 14,914 merge events (986 handled, 13,887 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
