FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 12,571 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 35,895 events, handled 6,476 and discarded 29,400; 19 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 13,605 out of cell events (3,024 handled, 10,566 discarded)
FINE    |  → 22,290 merge events (3,452 handled, 18,834 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
