FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 12,571 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 14,665 events, handled 555 and discarded 13,980; 130 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 7,657 out of cell events (489 handled, 7,106 discarded)
FINE    |  → 7,008 merge events (66 handled, 6,874 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
