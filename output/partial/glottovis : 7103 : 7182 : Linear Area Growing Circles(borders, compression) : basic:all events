FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using ROBUST + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 45,681 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 210,310 events, handled 17,762 and discarded 183,501; 9,047 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 83,391 out of cell events (10,756 handled, 66,931 discarded)
FINE    |  → 126,919 merge events (7,006 handled, 116,570 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
