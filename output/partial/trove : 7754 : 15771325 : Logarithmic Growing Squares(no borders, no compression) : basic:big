FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 13,680 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 42,754 events, handled 6,798 and discarded 35,930; 26 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 14,575 out of cell events (2,181 handled, 12,374 discarded)
FINE    |  → 28,179 merge events (4,617 handled, 23,556 discarded)
