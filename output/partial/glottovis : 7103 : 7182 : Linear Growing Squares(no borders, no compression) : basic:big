FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 12,571 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 15,058 events, handled 500 and discarded 14,296; 262 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 7,602 out of cell events (437 handled, 7,077 discarded)
FINE    |  → 7,456 merge events (63 handled, 7,219 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
