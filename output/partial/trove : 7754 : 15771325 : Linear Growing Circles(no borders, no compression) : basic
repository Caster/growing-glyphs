FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 13,680 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 40,753 events, handled 5,204 and discarded 29,536; 6,013 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 13,189 out of cell events (555 handled, 9,728 discarded)
FINE    |  → 27,564 merge events (4,649 handled, 19,808 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
