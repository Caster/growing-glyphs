FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 12,571 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 36,632 events, handled 6,828 and discarded 29,786; 18 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 13,961 out of cell events (3,365 handled, 10,582 discarded)
FINE    |  → 22,671 merge events (3,463 handled, 19,204 discarded)
