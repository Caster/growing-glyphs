FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using ROBUST + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 45,681 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 200,786 events, handled 16,663 and discarded 175,328; 8,795 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 79,857 out of cell events (9,703 handled, 64,360 discarded)
FINE    |  → 120,929 merge events (6,960 handled, 110,968 discarded)
