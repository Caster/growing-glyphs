FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 12,571 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 68,351 events, handled 16,503 and discarded 51,138; 710 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 23,770 out of cell events (9,542 handled, 13,956 discarded)
FINE    |  → 44,581 merge events (6,961 handled, 37,182 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
