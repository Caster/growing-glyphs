FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 13,680 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 95,920 events, handled 25,140 and discarded 67,793; 2,987 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 35,146 out of cell events (17,583 handled, 16,193 discarded)
FINE    |  → 60,774 merge events (7,557 handled, 51,600 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
