FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using ROBUST + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 49,830 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 282,620 events, handled 27,334 and discarded 223,347; 31,939 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 107,955 out of cell events (19,788 handled, 69,729 discarded)
FINE    |  → 174,665 merge events (7,546 handled, 153,618 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
