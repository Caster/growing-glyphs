FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using ROBUST + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 45,681 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 146,375 events, handled 6,403 and discarded 139,802; 170 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 57,662 out of cell events (2,974 handled, 54,582 discarded)
FINE    |  → 88,713 merge events (3,429 handled, 85,220 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
