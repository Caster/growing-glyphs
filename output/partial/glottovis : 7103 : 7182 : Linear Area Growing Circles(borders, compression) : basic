FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Area Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 12,571 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 70,906 events, handled 17,649 and discarded 52,509; 748 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 24,918 out of cell events (10,646 handled, 14,002 discarded)
FINE    |  → 45,988 merge events (7,003 handled, 38,507 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
