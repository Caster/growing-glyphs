FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Circles grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 12,571 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 38,219 events, handled 7,226 and discarded 30,973; 20 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 14,390 out of cell events (3,477 handled, 10,900 discarded)
FINE    |  → 23,829 merge events (3,749 handled, 20,073 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
