FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Logarithmic Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-4
FINE    |  created 12,571 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 34,421 events, handled 6,048 and discarded 28,350; 23 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 13,163 out of cell events (2,885 handled, 10,263 discarded)
FINE    |  → 21,258 merge events (3,163 handled, 18,087 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
