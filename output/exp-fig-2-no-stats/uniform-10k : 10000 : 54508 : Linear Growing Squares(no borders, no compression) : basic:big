FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,897 nodes and height 6, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 17,865 events initially, for 10,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 24,790 events, handled 2,445 and discarded 270; 22,075 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 12,450 out of cell events (1,730 handled, 163 discarded)
FINE    |  → 12,340 merge events (715 handled, 107 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
