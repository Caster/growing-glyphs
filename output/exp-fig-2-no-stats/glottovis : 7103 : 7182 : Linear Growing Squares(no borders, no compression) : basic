FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,569 nodes and height 11, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 12,571 events initially, for 7,103 glyphs
FINE    |  created 17,966 events, handled 1,440 and discarded 2,718; 13,808 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 8,593 out of cell events (682 handled, 1,278 discarded)
FINE    |  → 9,373 merge events (758 handled, 1,440 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
