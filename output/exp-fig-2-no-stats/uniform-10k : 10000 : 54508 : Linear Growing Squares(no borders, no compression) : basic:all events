FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using ROBUST + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,897 nodes and height 6, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 64,891 events initially, for 10,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 90,095 events, handled 2,455 and discarded 317; 87,323 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 46,970 out of cell events (1,740 handled, 177 discarded)
FINE    |  → 43,125 merge events (715 handled, 140 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
