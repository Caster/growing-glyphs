FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 13,680 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 40,224 events, handled 5,085 and discarded 15,503; 19,636 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 12,849 out of cell events (425 handled, 5,021 discarded)
FINE    |  → 27,375 merge events (4,660 handled, 10,482 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
