FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using TRACK + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 3,109 nodes and height 7, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 17,801 events initially, for 10,000 glyphs
FINE    |  created 31,502 events, handled 102 and discarded 20,162; 11,238 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 10,100 out of cell events (101 handled, 6,953 discarded)
FINE    |  → 21,402 merge events (1 handled, 13,209 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
