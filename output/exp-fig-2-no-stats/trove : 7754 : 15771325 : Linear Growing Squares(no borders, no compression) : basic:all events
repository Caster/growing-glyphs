FINE    |  clustering using the QuadTree Clusterer algorithm
FINE    |  clustering using ROBUST + NO BUCKETING strategy
FINE    |  using the Linear Growing Squares grow function
FINE    |  QuadTree has 2,993 nodes and height 15, having at most 10 glyphs per cell and cell size at least 1.0E-8
FINE    |  created 49,830 events initially, for 7,754 glyphs
FINE    |  created 429,698 events, handled 5,204 and discarded 348,227; 76,267 events were never considered
FINE    |  → 114,830 out of cell events (412 handled, 81,949 discarded)
FINE    |  → 314,868 merge events (4,792 handled, 266,278 discarded)
FINE    |  events were stored in 1 queue(s)
FINE    |  QuadTree has 1 nodes and height 0 now
