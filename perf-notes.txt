implement same level links in QuadTree

merge events with large squares in separate queue, with lowerbound on merge event time
t = d / (r_1 + r_2)
d' = (1 \pm \delta) d
r_1' = (1 + \epsilon) r_1
t' = d' / (r_1' + r_2) \geq (1 \pm \delta) d / (1 + \epsilon) (r_1 + r_2) = 1 / (1 + \epsilon) t - \delta / r_1

  - insert head of "uncertain" queue in normal event queue
  - get new head when old head is popped out of normal event queue
  - popping head: pop head, calculate up-to-date merge time, check if still head of queue
      - while no, insert in "uncertain" queue with lowerbound time and pop current head
      - we found up-to-date head, yay!
